# my_first_github_repo
Test repo following the tutorial instructions

This is a change to learn how to make a commit.
It will first be implemented only on the 'readme-edits' branch.

This is a test of a `code` block:
```yaml
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
```

That seems good enough for now.

A line I wrote on my local computer

This is a line from RStudio

This is yet another line (one day I'll actually write some `code`!). It should now come from the correct email address and account.
