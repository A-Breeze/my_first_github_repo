# my_first_github_repo
Test repo following the tutorial instructions

This is a change to learn how to make a commit.
It will first be implemented only on the 'readme-edits' branch.

This is a test of a `code` block:
```yaml
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
```

That seems good enough for now.
